# Predicting the Future Stock Price of Delta Airlines ✈️

The stock market is volatile and unpredictable, and single stocks are especially notoriously difficult to predict. 
Stock prices change from day to day, and trying to predict them is no easier than predicting the future. 
However, the price of tomorrow is undoubtedly dependent on today's price, yesterday's price, and so forth.
Using a univariate time series model to predict stock prices is returning to the basics--it allows for a clean and focused approach. 

In this project, I will use time series models to predict the future stock price of DAL (Delta Airlines). 

### Process Overview

1. [Get Data from yfinance](#Getting-the-Data)
2. [Check the Data for stationarity](#Check-for-Stationarity)
3. [Modeling](#Modeling)
     1. ARIMA with hyperparameters selected using ACF and PACF plots
     2. ARIMA with hyperparameters selected through autoARIMA
     3. ARIMA with hyperparameters selected through a loop search
     4. Prophet with hyperparameters selected through a loop search
4. [Predicting](#Predicting)
